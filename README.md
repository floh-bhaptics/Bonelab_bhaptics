# Bonelab_bhaptics
First simple bhaptics mod attempt for Bonelab. If you have questions or issues, ping me in the bhaptics Discord.

## Installation
1. Get the [MelonLoader installer](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation) and install MelonLoader >= 0.6.0 on your game executable.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics/Bonelab_bhaptics/releases/latest/) of the mod and unzip the contents into the "Mods" directory in your game folder.
3. Start the bhaptics Player and connect your gear, and start up the game.

## MelonLoader backwards compatibility
The popular Fusion mod for multiplayer support is running on MelonLoader 0.5.9, and there were breaking changes in MelonLoader since then. So, if you don't care about the Fusion mod, you can just install the latest MelonLoader and the latest mod release. If you want Fusion running, you will have to install MelonLoader 0.5.9, and then get [version 1.2.0](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics/Bonelab_bhaptics/releases/tag/v1.2.0) of the mod.

## Featured effects
- Gun recoil left/right
